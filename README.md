# Prediction of Rice Pest Attacks in Raipur Region using weather Data

# Abstract
In the constantly changing world of farming, rice
is a crucial food source. However, changes in the climate are
hurting how much rice we can grow. To ensure pest management,
it is important to predict pests early. Rice is the one of the
world’s most important crop, providing a significant portion of
the daily caloric intake for billions of people especially in India.
In Raipur region, Rice stem borers can cause up to 60% yield
loss. They can cause dead hearts at the vegetative stage and
produce chaffy grains at the reproductive stage. Leaf folders can
decrease yield up to 6.2%. Climate change has increased pest
attacks. This paper proposes predicting five rice pests—Yellow
Stem Border, Leaf Folder, Brown Plant Hopper, Gall Midge,
and Green Leaf Hopper—in the Raipur region using a web
application based on environmental conditions.The assessment
of the suggested solution depends on the effectiveness of the
machine learning model and its precision in forecasting pest
attacks on rice crops. Machine learning models use data like
maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin),
relative humidity (RHI), rainfall (RF), and sunshine hours (SSH)
to forecast pest attacks. Five classification algorithms were tested:
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SMO, linear regression, and
Gaussian Naive Bayes. Random Forest achieved the highest
accuracy at 98%.
## How to Use the Application

1. **Select Your Region:**
   - Begin by choosing the specific region for which you want to predict pest attacks.
   ![Select Region](https://github.com/dorakolla/Pest_Attack_Prediction_using_weather_data/assets/73239478/c3c86b54-2b83-450f-a82a-0ba528fbf830)

2. **Redirect to Information Page:**
   - Once the region is selected, the application redirects to another page offering detailed information on predicted pest attacks and guidance on effective management strategies.
